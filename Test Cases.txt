      6
      Array Elements:
      1 4 7 8 11 4 
      for sum 19 yielded: [0, 2, 4], [1, 2, 3], [1, 4, 5],
      [2, 3, 5], and [3, 4]


2.    Number of elements:
      7
      Array Elements: 
      3 2 1 6 8 3 1
      For sum 8 yielded: [0, 1, 5], [0, 2, 5, 6], [1, 3],
      [2, 3, 6], and [4]


3.    Number of elements: 
      5
      Array Elements:
      1 4 7 19 11 
      for sum 30 yielded: [1, 2, 3] and [3, 4]


4.    Number of elements:
      a
      Output: Sorry. That was not a number! Enter a count number:
      3
      Array Elemnts:
      1 2 3
      for sum 3 yielded: [0, 1] and [2]

5.    Number of Elements:
      0
      Output: Sorry. You cannot have an array with less than 1 elements. Enter a different number!
      10
      Array elements:
      2, 3, 15, 9, 6, 3, 1, 10, 2, -7
      For sum 21 yielded:
      [[0, 1, 2, 6], [0, 1, 3, 4, 6], [0, 1, 4, 7], [0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8], [0, 2, 5, 6], [0, 3, 4, 5, 6], [0, 3, 7], [0, 4, 5, 7], [0,4, 6, 7, 8], [1, 2, 5], [1, 2, 6, 8], [1, 3, 4, 5], [1, 3, 4, 6, 8], [1, 4, 7, 8], [2, 4], [2, 5, 6, 8], [3, 4, 5, 6, 8], [3,7, 8], [4, 5, 7, 8]]
